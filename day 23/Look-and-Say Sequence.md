Find the n’th term in Look-and-say (Or Count and Say) Sequence. The look-and-say sequence is the sequence of the below integers: 
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, … 

How is the above sequence generated? 
n’th term is generated by reading (n-1)’th term.

The first term is "1"

Second term is "11", generated by reading first term as "One 1" 
(There is one 1 in previous term)

Third term is "21", generated by reading second term as "Two 1"

Fourth term is "1211", generated by reading third term as "One 2 One 1" 

and so on
